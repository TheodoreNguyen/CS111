CS111 project 3B, Spring 2016 - submission by THEODORE NGUYEN, UID: 704-156-701

included files: Makefile, README, lab3b.py

shell command to compile: you don't compile things in python
	-- note that my default "make" in the makefile just basically takes the python source code
	and copies it to a file labeled "lab3b", then gives execute permission to it. From it, you
	can basically execute it as ./lab3b

shell command to execute: python lab3b.py

It works on the 6 CSV's given, as the output i get when diffing my output with the given check
file (after sorting both of them) provides no output. Not too sure about if it will work on
others though
